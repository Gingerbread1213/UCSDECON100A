f(x,y)[utility]
g(x,y)[budget constrain]

Lagrangian 

$\lambda$ is the change of the utility per change of income $\frac{du(x,y)}{dY}$

at the optimal solution, $\frac{fx(x,y)}{fy(x,y)} = \frac{gx(x,y)}{gy(x,y)}$ where MRS = MRT

interior solution means strictly positive quantite for both x and y, 
cornor solution means the consumer only want one of the good.
